    "# Basic Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will look into the basics of building ML models with Scikit-Learn. Scikit-Learn is the most widely used Python library for ML, especially outside of deep learning (where there are several contenders and I recommend using Keras, which is a package that provides a simple API on top of several underlying contenders like TensorFlow and PyTorch).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll proceed in this fashion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- give a brief overview of key terminology and the ML workflow\n",
    "- illustrate the typical use of SciKit-Learn API through some simple examples\n",
    "- discuss various metrics that can be used to evaluate ML models\n",
    "- dive deeper with some more complex examples\n",
    "- look at the various ways we can validate and improve our models\n",
    "- discuss the topic of feature engineering - ML models are good examples of \"garbage in, garbage out\", so cleaning our data and getting the right features is important\n",
    "- finally, summarize some of the main model techniques and their pros and cons\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to focus on practical ML, and will not be going much into the internal details of the various algorithms. We're also going to avoid the topics of *Deep Learning* and *neural nets*: these are generating a lot of hype at present but in general involve learning thousands of parameters requiring massive amounts of data for training (and a lot of time). The techniques we are going to look at can be used for much smaller problems and are generally very fast to train. It's worth having them in your toolkit and progressing to deep learning later.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It's worth noting that getting good data and the right features is generally more important than the type of model \n",
    "> you choose to use. The performance of the different types of ML model techniques is often similar. It's commonly\n",
    "> said in ML circles that 80% of time is spent on getting data cleaned up and doing *feature engineering* and only 20%\n",
    "> is spent on modeling. For example, until around 2014 when deep learning started taking off, most ML models at Google \n",

    "> *learn* features that would otherwise need to be engineered by hand, and can thus automate some of the manual work\n",

    "## ML Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "*Machine Learning* is the process of building models from data, either to gain insight into the data or to make predictions for new data (generalization). There are two main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *supervised learning*, in which the data (*training data*) is labeled with an known outcome (this is the *supervision* part), and the aim is to predict new outcomes from new data; if the outcome is a category this is *classification* while if the outcome is a continuous quantity this is *regression*\n",
    "- *unsupervised learning*, in which the data is analyzed for underlying patterns to gain insight; common examples are *clustering* (finding similar cases), *outlier detection* (finding unusual cases), and *dimensionality reduction* (reducing the number of variables needed to represent the data, essentially a form of lossy compression)\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in ML is typically tabular. The columns are called *features* while the rows are *instances* or *observations*. For supervised learning, we call the  output the *target* or *label*. We'll often refer to the vector if features as X and the output (label) as y, and say that we're trying to find a function that approximates f(X)=y; this function is our *model* and is characterized by some *model parameters*. We usually choose the type or class of model, and then use ML techniques to learn the model parameters that minimize the *error* (the difference between the predicted and actual output). More generally we can think of this as an optimization problem, where we are trying to learn the parameters that minimize a *loss function*; that loss function is typically going to be some cumulative function of the errors; a common loss function is RMSE (root mean square of errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "While we learn the model parameters, there are some other parameters we need to specify as inputs to the model too; these are called *hyperparameters*. For example, if we learn a decision tree model, the parameters might be the features being tested at each branch and the values they are being tested against, while the hyperparameters would include the depth that we want to limit the tree to. For a polynomial regression model, the parameters would be the coefficients of the polynomial, while the hyperparameters could include the degree of polynomial we want to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ML Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical machine learning workflow begins with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- getting the data\n",
    "- exploring and cleaning up the data (handling missing values, normalizing values, removing bad data and outliers, encoding data in appropriate representations, and more)\n",
    "- possibly creating some additional synthetic values (e.g. we could use linear regression to fit a higher-order polynomial by creating synthetic values that are existing values raised to the power 2, 3, etc; other common examples might be computing and including aggregate values like means and standard deviations of some of the original values)\n",
    "- picking a type of model to use, and configuring the initial hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "After which we could do multiple iterations of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- training the model\n",
    "- evaluating the results\n",
    "- adjusting the model type or the hyperparameters if the results are not yet satisfactory\n",
    "\n",
    "And this second phase could necessitate a return to the first phase, to get more data or create more synthetic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperparameter tuning could be done manually or may itself be automated by doing a state-space search through the possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some number of iterations, if we have a model that improves upon existing capabilities, we would want to deploy it. For the model to be useful, new data that we apply the model to should have similar properties to the training data (i.e. we rely on our test set being representative of the new data). If this is not true (e.g. because the future is just different and unpredictable, or perhaps we have *overfit* the training data), the model likely will not generalize well. If it is true, then we may be done, at least for some time, but in many cases future data will eventually diverge from the past and the model will degrade. We thus need to get more recent data, retrain, retune, and redeploy. The cadence of these refreshes will depend on the particular problem we are addressing. For example, if we build a model to recognize species of flowers we may need to retrain very infrequently or possibly never, as the primary reason to retrain is that we discover species that the model has not accounted for. On the other hand, if we build a model to detect fraudulent behavior we are pitting the model against adversaries that are adaptive and intelligent and we may need constant refreshes.\n"

In this case we would want to know what probability value to pick as a threshold to distinguish between 0/1 with maximum accuracy. There is a trade-off - as we move the threshold we may get more true positives but we're also going to get more false positives. The AUC shows this trade-off this accuracy for different thresholds.

If we ran this as a model, and passed the same training data in as test data, we would get an exact match every time, suggesting we have a 100% accurate model! But if we gave the model new data it hadn't seen, it would fail dismally, not even being able to predict a result. We could address this by using some kind of fuzzy matching of hash keys, so at least we could get predictions out, but the result is likely to be a poor model. This illustrates two problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- we shouldn't test with our training data or we are likely to get an unreasonable expectation of accuracy\n",

This suggests that if we train a model using all the data, the accuracy when tested on new data should be somewhere between A1 and A2.\n",

More generally, we will split the data into k pieces of *folds*, $F_1$, $F_2$, ..., $F_k$, and then build $k$ models, where the $n$th model uses $F_n$ as the test set and the remaining pieces excluding $F_n$ as the training set. The $k$ individual scores are then combined into a final score (mean and standard deviation). This is called *k-fold cross validation*. The size of each fold must  be large enough to be a reasonable sample of the problem, while allowing enough repetitions of the train-test evaluation of the algorithm to provide a fair estimate of the algorithms performance on new data. Commonly-used values for k are 5 or 10, although we can go all the way to the extreme where $k$ is the size of the training set; this is called *leave-one-out cross validation*.  It is computationally expensive and the results have high variance.\n",

This means that if we have a lot of data, it can be useful to measure how well the model is doing as we are training it, so we can stop when we reach the point where the further improvements are negligible.

By doing the scaling in a pipeline along with model fitting this is less likely to occur. \n",

    "## Combining Model Predictions with Ensembles\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve performance is to combine the results of several models. There are several ways this can be done; for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Bagging* - building multiple models (typically of the same type) from different subsamples of the training dataset. Sampling is done with replacement, and the predictions are combined and averaged into a final result.\n",
    "* *Boosting* - building multiple models (typically of the same type) each of which learns to fix the prediction errors of a prior model in the sequence of models.\n",
    "* *Voting* - building multiple models (typically of differing types) and simple statistics (like calculating the mean) are used to combine predictions. *Stacking* is a voting approach which also learns the weights to give to each vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a model type in `model`, we can do bagging with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "model = ...\n",
    "model = BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=model, n_estimators=50, random_state=0)\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are another example of bagging. [AdaBoost](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#adaboost) is an example of a popular boosting algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreting Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a good model, how do we interpret the results? That is, how can we justify the prediction when it is questioned?\n",
    "\n",
    "For decision trees, this is not that difficult - the path through the decision tree illustrates the \"reasoning\" behind the decision. However, for many other models there is no intuitive interpretation. Getting a ranking of feature importance is helpful but not complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been some interesting work in this area for classification models. The approach is to rely on a form of sensitivity analysis - ask, \"what small changes in the inputs would result in different outputs?\". This can be done one a case by case basis, with the learnings often being generalizable to cover more cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is really out of scope for this notebook, but if you are interested in learning more, the seminal work is [LIME](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/blog/lime/), and other popular approaches are [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) and [Skater](https://www.datascience.com/resources/tools/skater).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Taking It Further\n",
    "\n",
    "*[Data leakage](https://medium.com/@colin.fraser/the-treachery-of-leakage-56a2d7c4e931)* is something to look out for, and [high-dimensional data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)  introduces some interesting effects that you should be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good practical online course can be found here: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python while https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning covers more theory but in a gentle way.\n",
