    "# Python Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python's Origins\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation began in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language. It takes its name from Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamic language but is strongly typed (i.e. variables are untyped but refer to objects of fixed type).\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### How Python Evolves\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Python evolves in a fairly straightforward way, more-or-less like this:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - people propose changes by writing *Python Enhancement Proposals* (PEPs): https://www.python.org/dev/peps/\n",
    "> - the Python core committee will assign a 'dictator' who will decide whether the PEP is worthy of becoming part of the standard, and if so it does, after some amount of discussion and revision\n",
    "> - disagreements are finally settled by Guido van Rossum, Python's inventor and the 'Benevolent Dictator for Life' (BDFL)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> An important standard PEP is the Style Guide, PEP-8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). By default, PyCharm will warn of any PEP-8 violations. There are external tools such as `flake8` (https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) that can be used to check code for compliance in other environments.\n"

    "\n",
    "For Python questions and Python data science questions, make use of StackOverflow. Pay attention to comments on suggested answers; the \"accepted answer\" is often not the best. Look for comments about whether it is the \"most Pythonic\". Python has an idiomatic style different to many other languages and so a novice coming from another language will often accept an answer that is closer to idiomatic in that other language rather than Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "### \"Batteries Included\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is often described as having \"batteries included\". This is a reference to the rich set of libraries (packages)included in the standard distribution as well as the vast collection of freely available packages that can be used to bootstrap your development.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Python 2.7 or Python 3.x?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use conda to create a Python 2.7 virtual environment for when you have to use 2.7, but all new projects should be Python 3.5 or later. Python 2.7 is the end of the 2.x line and is supposed to be end-of-lifed in 2020. Avoid it; the only reason to use it is if there is a package you really need that hasn't been ported yet.\n",

    "Python scripts are stored in plain text files with `.py` extensions. You can run the script `foo.py` at the command line by invoking `python foo.py`. When you do so the Python interpreter will compile the script to an intermediate bytecode, and the result will be stored in a file with the same base name and a `.pyc` extension. As an optimisation, the interpreter will look to see if a `.pyc` file with a more recent file modification date exists when you invoke it to run a script and use that if it does. In Python 2.x these files were saved alongside the Python source files but in Python 3.x they are stored in a subdirectory named `__pycache__`.\n",

The most useful functions here are related to getting the system time zone and the `time.sleep()` function which pauses execution;\n",

The most commonly used one, that extends the functionality of `datetime`, is `dateutil` (https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) but another that is growing in popularity is `arrow` (http://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which provides a completely different approach with a very natural API. \n",
