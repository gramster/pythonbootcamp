    "# Python Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python's Origins\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation began in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language. It takes its name from Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamic language but is strongly typed (i.e. variables are untyped but refer to objects of fixed type).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Python Evolves\n",
    "\n",
    "Python evolves in a fairly straightforward way, more-or-less like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- people propose changes by writing *Python Enhancement Proposals* (PEPs)\n",
    "- the Python core committee will assign a 'dictator' who will decide whether the PEP is worthy of becoming part of the standard, and if so it does, after some amount of discussion and revision\n",
    "- disagreements are finally settled by Guido van Rossum, Python's inventor and the 'Benevolent Dictator for Life' (BDFL)\n",
    "\n",
    "An important standard PEP is the Style Guide, PEP-8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). By default, PyCharm will warn of any PEP-8 violations. There are external tools such as `flake8` (https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) that can be used to check code for compliance in other environments.\n"

    "## StackOverflow is your friend!\n",
    "\n",
    "For Python questions and Python data science questions, make use of StackOverflow. Pay attention to comments on suggested answers; the \"accepted answer\" is not always the best. Look for comments about whether it is the \"most Pythonic\".\n",
    "\n",
    "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python 2.7 or Python 3.x?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use conda to create a Python 2.7 virtual environment for when you have to use 2.7, but all new projects should be Python 3.5 or later. Python 2.7 is the end of the 2.x line and is supposed to be end-of-lifed in 2020. Avoid it; the only reason to use it is if there is a package you really need that hasn't been ported yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python docs\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/ has very detailed documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Python packages have good documentation at https://readthedocs.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Python a lot on a Mac you may find Dash useful: https://kapeli.com/dash\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, Python has a help() function that is very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way to install packages is with `pip install`. However, if you have installed `conda` you should use `conda install` first and only if that fails use `pip install`. Conda has a smaller set of packages which is why it doesn't always succeed, but the ones it does have have been built for Conda so installing that way is preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `conda uninstall` or `pip uninstall` to remove packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what packages are installed use `pip freeze`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot more to package installation than this but this is enough for 90%+ of what you will do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the REPL\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the REPL, just type `python` at the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `help()` function to read the documentation for a module/class/function. As a standalone invocation, you enter the help system and can explore various topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python scripts are stored in plain text files with `.py` extensions. You can run the script `foo.py` at the command line by invoking `python foo.py`. When you do so the Python interpreter will compile the script to an intermediate bytecode, and the result will be stored in a file with the same base name and a `.pyc` extension. As an optimisation, the interpreter will look to see if a `.pyc` file with a more recent file modification date exists when you invoke it to run a script and use that if it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A better REPL: bpython\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.bpython-interpreter.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install with `pip install bpython`.\n",
    "\n",
    "bpython adds a number of useful features at the command line, like syntax highlighting and auto-completion. If you're going to use the command line repl I recommend it, although there are other options too that I haven't tried:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python is an OOPL\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a pure object-oriented language. Operators are simply methods on a class. The Python interpreter will convert an infix operator to an instance method call.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there is an `int` class for integers. The operation `int(3)` boxes the literal 3 up into an `int` object instance. There is an `__add__` method defined on that class for addition. So:\n",
    "\n",
    "    3 + 4\n",
    "    \n",
    "is the same as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.__add__(4)\n",
    "    \n",
    "The double underscore in Python is called 'dunder' and is used extensively internally; `__add__` is called a dunder-method. Dunder-methods are important to understand if you want to take full advantage of Python hence this early introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the methods on a class by using the `dir` function, for example `dir(int)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss how to define new classes later. A key takeaway here is that this use of dunder-methods allows us to override many operators simply by overriding the associated dunder-method. Two particularly useful ones are `__str__` (cast to string) and `__repr__` (cast to text representation); these are typically the same for a class but need not be. For example, notice the differences here:"

    "## Indentation and Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Pythomn does not use {} for demarcating blocks of code; instead it uses indentation. This distinguishes it from most other programming languages and can take some getting used to. In particular, it requires care when pasting code in an editor (most Python editors are smart about this but other editors are not). The reason for this choice is that Guido originally designed Python as a teaching language and favored readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convention in Python is to indent with spaces, not tabs (this avoids tab settings causing misnterpretation of code). Indentation standard is 4 spaces at a time, although some companies have different conventions (usually 2, if not 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments start with # and continue to the end of the line. By convention if # is used on the same line as code it should be preceded by at least two spaces."
